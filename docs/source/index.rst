welltrajconvert Overview
========================================================

:mod:`welltrajconvert` is a Python package for wellbore directional survey conversion. It allows the user to take the bare minimum required wellbore directional survey data and uses a minimum curvature algorithm to calculate additional metadata. Why should you use :mod:`welltrajconvert`?

* You have a single survey with only the MD, INC, AZIM, and surface latitude and longitude and need additional metadata.

* You have a single survey with only the MD, INC, AZIM, and surface x and y coordinates and need additional metadata.

* You want to display your wellbore trajectory geospatially using latitude and longitude points along the wellbore.

* Helpful Documentation. You're looking at it. ;)

Here's an example, to give you an impression::

   from welltrajconvert.wellbore_trajectory import *
   well_dict = {
   "wellId": "well_A",
   "md": [5600.55, 5800.0, 5900.0],
   "inc": [85.03, 89.91, 90.97],
   "azim": [27.59, 26.69, 26.72],
   "surface_latitude": 29.90829444,
   "surface_longitude": 47.68852083
   }
   dev_obj = WellboreTrajectory(well_dict) # get wellbore trajectory object
   dev_obj.calculate_survey_points() # runs through min curve algo, calc lat lon points, and calc horizontal
   json_ds = dev_obj.serialize() # serialize to json
   json_ds_obj = json.loads(json_ds)
   df = pd.DataFrame(json_ds_obj) # convert dict to dataframe
   df.head() # display dataframe

On the surface it looks quite simple. Behind the scenes there is a lot more interesting stuff going on:

* Bring data in and convert it into a dataclass object.

* Validate the data conforms to proper directional survey structure for the minimum curvature algorithm.

* Check if surface latitude and longitude or surface x and y are provided.

* Calculate horizontal section based on default or user input angle.

* Serialize and deserialize data into a format that can be used in a variety of applications.

* Ability to take in a variety of data sources and formats and compute metadata.
