Welcome to directional-survey-converter's documentation!
========================================================

Directional-survey-converter gives you and easy way to convert the numerous different styles of wellbore directional surveys often delivered by service companies into a standard format with all the metadata a user is typically interested in. Using the bare minimum information given the directional-survey-converter uses a minimum curvature algorithm to calculate survey points along the wellbore so the user can have all the data they need to perform their analysis. Why should you use the directional-survey-converter?

* You have a single survey with only the MD, INC, AZIM, and surface latitude and longitude and need additional metadata.

* You have a single survey with only the MD, INC, AZIM, and surface x and y coordinates and need additional metadata.

* You want to display your wellbore trajectory geospatially using latitude and longitude points along the wellbore.

* Helpful Documentation. You're looking at it. ;)
